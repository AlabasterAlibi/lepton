Lepton is a Quark/Luiafk-inspired mod that aims to implement many small quality of life changes, resulting in an enhanced vanilla-like experience.

Currently, it adds:
- An Angler Armor set bonus, adding an extra line on cast
- A Tinker upgrade for the Ancient Chisel and related accessories
- Flying versions of the Safe and Defender's Forge
- The Slime Staff to King Slime's drops at a 25% chance
- An instant-research hotkey in Journey Mode (Ctrl + Shift while hovering over an item)
- Compatibility with AutoTrash to automatically trash fully researched items in Journey Mode
- A config menu to toggle all of the above

Much, much more to come.
